# Benchmarking Non-Comparison Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains research and benchmarking of non-comparison sorting algorithms. The project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of various non-comparison sorting algorithms such as Radix Sort, Counting Sort, and Bucket Sort under different conditions and datasets.

## Project Overview

Non-comparison sorting algorithms can achieve better time complexity than traditional comparison-based algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort in specific scenarios. This project benchmarks these algorithms to understand their performance characteristics and practical applications.
